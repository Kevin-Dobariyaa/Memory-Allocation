## Introduction

This project is a simulation of various memory allocation techniques used in operating systems to allocate memory to processes. The algorithms covered in this project are:
- First Fit
- Best Fit
- Worst Fit

Each of these techniques is implemented to manage dynamic memory allocation efficiently, showcasing the differences in memory usage and fragmentation.

## Features

- **First Fit**: Allocates the first block of memory that is large enough for the process.
- **Best Fit**: Allocates the smallest block of memory that is large enough for the process, minimizing wasted space.
- **Worst Fit**: Allocates the largest available block, trying to leave larger unused blocks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kevin-Dobariyaa/Memory-Allocation.git
